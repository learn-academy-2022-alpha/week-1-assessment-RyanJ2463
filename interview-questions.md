# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: A conditional statement is using the if else statements. They are very useful in the case you want you machine to output different answers depending on the input. 

  Researched answer: Conditional statements are a sequence of well-defined instructions that produce a unique output based on the value of the input. Conditionals follow a flowchart-like structure and allow you create logic in your code.



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: git stores information for your local machine that can be used to transfered to github which is online.

  Researched answer: Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: In my experience so far there are three operators that will return a boolean value. Using equality and logical operators will return true or false. There is a third operator that will also return true or false, but I can not think of the name. This operator uses the greater and less than symbols.

  Researched answer: Evaluations, Equality and Relational



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: The index tells the machine where in the array it is. The vaule is the information in the array. For example we have an array that has 3 values in it [cat, dog, bird]. the index of the first word is 0 and the value of it would be cat.

  Researched answer: Each element in the array must be a JavaScript data type. The content of each element is called the value.Every value in an array has a particular location know as the index. Indexes are sequential numbers that are a bit like an address for every element in the array. Arrays are zero indexed which means the elements are numbered starting with the number 0 and increase by one whole number for each new element.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: In my experience an iteration is used in an for loop and determines how the code will run through an array.

  Researched answer: iteration is the process of performing a particular action a certain number of times or until a condition is met. A common form of iteration is called a for loop. A for loop defines a variable and increments or decrements the variable on each iteration.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Proper pair programming uses a driver and a navigator. The navigator will give the driver direction by telling them the main idea for example use a for loop. The driver writes the code and focuses on all the correct symbols.

  Researched answer: iteration is the process of performing a particular action a certain number of times or until a condition is met. A common form of iteration is called a for loop. A for loop defines a variable and increments or decrements the variable on each iteration.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A higher-order function is a function that either takes in another function as an argument or returns another function as an output.

2. Jest: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework.

3. Objects: Objects are a datatype that contain collections of key:value pairs

4. Method: When a function belongs to an object it is called a method.

5. Classes: Classes are a particular type of function that contain data and behavior. Classes are the blueprints of objects. Just like functions, classes have their own scope.
